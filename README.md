## About Tensorflow
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Tensorflow_logo.svg"></a>
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.[3] It is used for both research and production at Google often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.

TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. More deatils can be found out about tensorflow by clicking on the <b>Tensorflow Logo</b> above 


## Problem set: Tensorflow
These problems relate to the Python package Tensorflow. We will again use the famous iris data set. Save your work as a single Jupyter notebook file in a GitHub repository. Include any required data files, a README, and a gitignore file in the repository.

# 1. Use Tensorflow to create model
Neural Network for the Iris Dataset using TensorFlow
Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flower's sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

# 2. Split the data into training and testing

Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

# 3. Train the model

Use the testing set to train your model.

# 4. Test the model

Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.
